# celeste-collab-teleport

# Purpose

CollabTeleport is a Celeste mod that allows players to teleport to the next collab level rather than self-navigate to it to save time (probably only minutes of time but that's still something - I spent 5+ minutes trying to find another collab level to play lmao). I wanted to get this out before the 2021 winter collab that _should_ be coming soon.

This mod adds two new debug commands:
- `collabtp (mapname: optional)` - Teleport player to specified map name. Default: nearest noncompleted level from player
  - Note: spaces must be replaced with underscores
- `collablist` - List all collab levels found in current lobby.

# Usage

Build the solution, package it s.t. Everest can read it, and place it in your Mods folder.

# TODO
- Submit a release to gamebanana
