# celeste-collab-teleport

# Purpose

CollabTeleport is a Celeste mod that allows players to teleport to the next collab level rather than self-navigate to it to save time (probably only minutes of time but that's still something - I spent 5+ minutes trying to find another collab level to play lmao). I wanted to get this out before the 2021 winter collab that (should) be coming soon.

This mod adds a new debug command `collabtp` that performs this procedure.

# Usage

Build the solution, package it s.t. Everest can read it, and place it in your Mods folder.

# TODO
- Submit a release to gamebanana
